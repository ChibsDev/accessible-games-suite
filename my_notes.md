Quick React crash course:

-function App() - This is a React component (like a reusable piece of UI)
-useState(0) - Creates a state variable (like a class variable in Python)
-return (...) - Returns JSX (looks like HTML, but it's JavaScript)
-When count changes, React re-renders the component automatically
